1. Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file and show the output for test cases. Develop an interactive program by Compareing the result by implementing LIST THEN ELIMINATE algorithm.

2. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Eliminationalgorithm. Output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

3. Demonstrate Pre processing (Data Cleaning, Integration and Transformation) activity on suitable data:
For example:
Identify and Delete Rows that Contain Duplicate Data by considering an appropriate
dataset.
Identify and Delete Columns That Contain a Single Value by considering an
appropriate dataset.

4. Demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge toclassify a new sample.

5. Demonstrate the working of the Random forest algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building and apply this knowledge toclassify a new sample.

6. Implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.

7. Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naive Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.

8. Construct aBayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set.

9. Demonstrate the working of EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file.

10. Demonstrate the working of SVM classifier for a suitable data set.
